At present (2013), UAM fish collection holdings consist of approximately 6000 lots collected over the past five decades. The collection is the repository of oceanographic field surveys in the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas along with freshwater material collected by researchers at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. More recently, the collection has been growing through the field efforts of state and federal agencies, as well as substantial transfers of lots from the privately held Point Stephens Research collection.
