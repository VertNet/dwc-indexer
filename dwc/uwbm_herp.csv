The collection has particularly strong geographic representation of the Pacific Northwest. More than 2,200 specimens are forest-dwelling amphibians from Western Washington obtained during wildlife studies in the 1980s and early 1990s. About 900 are garter snakes collected during the mid-1900s. In 2010, Dr. Adam Leache joined the Burke Museum as Curator of Genetic Resources and Herpetology. The entire collection was inventoried, catalogued, and georeferenced. This transition made the Burke Herpetology data searchable and mappable to the public for the first time. The geographic scope of the collection has expended greatly since 2010, and new collections from Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Ghana are now available that reflect active research programs by herpetology staff. The collection consists largely of alcohol-reserved specimens with a small number of photographs and skeletons. Genetic resources are available for all specimens collected since 2010.

The collection has particularly strong geographic representation of the Pacific Northwest. More than 2,200 specimens are forest-dwelling amphibians from Western Washington obtained during wildlife studies in the 1980s and early 1990s. About 900 are garter snakes collected during the mid-1900s. In 2010, Dr. Adam Leache joined the Burke Museum as Curator of Genetic Resources and Herpetology. The entire collection was inventoried, catalogued, and georeferenced. This transition made the Burke Herpetology data searchable and mappable to the public for the first time. The geographic scope of the collection has expended greatly since 2010, and new collections from Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Ghana are now available that reflect active research programs by herpetology staff. The collection consists largely of alcohol-reserved specimens with a small number of photographs and skeletons. Genetic resources are available for all specimens collected since 2010.
