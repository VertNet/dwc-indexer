It contains more than 65,000 specimens in two sub-collections: paleontology and geology (not databased yet). The paleontology collection houses both vertebrate and invertebrate specimens, ranging from Cambrian archaeocyathids to Quaternary mammals. Significantly, it is the largest collection of polar dinosaurs in the world with 10,000 specimens, primarily from the North Slope of Alaska. It also comprises a diverse assortment of Alaskan Quaternary mammals, including a large portion of the material collected throughout Alaska by Otto W. Geist between the late 1920s and the 1960s. The collection also contains a variety of paleobotanical specimens and a large collection of invertebrates (both micro- and macrofossils). It is home to 39 holotypes and 409 paratypes, most of which are invertebrates. The collection is growing through active research projects in different regions of Alaska and collaboration with state and federal agencies.

It contains more than 65,000 specimens in two sub-collections: paleontology and geology (not databased yet). The paleontology collection houses both vertebrate and invertebrate specimens, ranging from Cambrian archaeocyathids to Quaternary mammals. Significantly, it is the largest collection of polar dinosaurs in the world with 10,000 specimens, primarily from the North Slope of Alaska. It also comprises a diverse assortment of Alaskan Quaternary mammals, including a large portion of the material collected throughout Alaska by Otto W. Geist between the late 1920s and the 1960s. The collection also contains a variety of paleobotanical specimens and a large collection of invertebrates (both micro- and macrofossils). It is home to 39 holotypes and 409 paratypes, most of which are invertebrates. The collection is growing through active research projects in different regions of Alaska and collaboration with state and federal agencies.
