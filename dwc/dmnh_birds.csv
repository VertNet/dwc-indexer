The holdings represent about 4,000 bird species. About 140 taxa are in the type collection. The alcohol collection was eighth in the world in 1982 (Wood et al. 1982) and has nearly doubled in size since then, the skeleton collection was 18th in the world in 1986 (Wood & Schnell 1986), and the egg collection is second largest in North America (Kiff & Hough 1985). All skeletal and alcohol specimen data are entered into a computer database, as are all of the study skins. The egg collection data is not in a database. The collection, worldwide in scope, has especially strong collections of Philippine and Central and South American birds. Extinct species are also represented. Formation of the collection began when the Museum was founded in 1957. Among the collections that can be found here are those of George Miksch Sutton, Allan R. Phillips, Olin S. Pettingill, T.D.
