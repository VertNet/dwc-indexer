A bit later we noticed what turned out to be four marmot pups watching us from near the mouth of a burrow under a large boulder. Later an adult appeared again, browsing on vegetation. The photo shows this adult, but we have better photos of the pups if that's useful. The location is a large rubble pile at the base of the cliff - a site that seemed ideal for marmots with lots of lush vegetation on a south-facing slope, and large conglomerate boulders to provide burrow sites. We heard reports from McNeil of a site nearby that usually has marmots, but it wasn't clear if it was the same location or not. They also reported one wandering marmot passing through camp this year, which they said is unusual.""
