It is a part of the Department of Zoology and Physiology. This is a small collection of older specimens mostly from Wyoming. There are currently no genetic resources associated with this collection. The majority of specimens were collected during the 1940s through 1960s, and the most important specimens are Wyoming Toads (Anaxyrus baxteri) collected by Baxter on the Laramie plains.
