With the exception of birds, our collections are the largest collections of their kind in Colorado. Specimens from Colorado and the surrounding plains, plateaus, and basins are the strength of our collection. Since our specimens document changes in biodiversity over the last 200 years, they are treasures of biological and historical significance. <br><br>Mammal specimens are typically preserved as a set of a study skin and an extracted skull, although large mammals are prepared also as hides, taxidermy, and skeletons. Many people have added to the mammal collection over the years, including the pioneer Colorado naturalist, Edward Royal Warren (3,000+ specimens), Donald A. Spencer, Dallas A. Sutton, Leslie Viereck, and emeritus professor and former Museum Director, David M. Armstrong. E.R. Warren's archive of field notes and photographs are an invaluable resource for documenting distributions and changes of Colorado mammals in the first three decades of the 20th century.
