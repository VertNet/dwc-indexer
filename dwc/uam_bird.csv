The collection consists of over 30,000 birds. Almost all bird species and subspecies known to occur in Alaska are represented and are preserved primarily as skins, skeletons, and tissues. Most recent preparations include skin, partial skeleton, tissue, and stomach samples for each individual. Tissues are part of the UAM Genomic Resources Collection.
