A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species.

The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species.

A research collection of more than 2,500 bird and mammal skins from various parts of the U.S. is maintained for advanced study and research.  The museum mounts are the work of Richard Schmidt whose career began as a school boy in 1925 and culminated with his retirement as taxidermist at Emporia State University (then Emporia Kansas State College). The specimens in the museum are grouped taxonomically and allow visitors to see clearly the color and structural details useful in identifying species. Other interesting features include displays of rare specimens collected in Kansas, invertebrates, an egg collection, unusual color patterns of certain species, techniques for preparing museum mounts, and a tallgrass prairie diorama.
