We have a small selection of larval fish from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands maintained in 10% formalin. Our skeletal collection contains 794 cleared and stained fish, as well as 410 dry skeletal preps. Many of the skeletal specimens originate from W. W. Dalquest and his students. We also have a tissue collection currently with over 515 samples preserved in 100% ethanol frozen in liquid nitrogen. Our type collection includes 3 holotypes, 110 paratypes, and 1 allotype. Our holdings were collected between 1927 and present and there was a significant increase in collections during 1950–1980, mainly by Clark Hubbs and his students. In 1993 we acquired the collections of the University of Texas at Austin’s Marine Science Institute, totaling ~ 3,000 lots of ethanol preserved specimens from the Gulf of Mexico. Between 2000 and 2011 we acquired collections of ethanol preserved specimens from Midwestern University, Texas Tech University, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, The University of Texas at Brownsville and Lamar University. We are working on cataloging these specimens, and will make those data available as soon as possible. Our collection is rapidly growing and many of our incoming specimens come from Dean Hendrickson and his students, museum staff, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and various researchers.

We have a small selection of larval fish from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands maintained in 10% formalin. Our skeletal collection contains 794 cleared and stained fish, as well as 410 dry skeletal preps. Many of the skeletal specimens originate from W. W. Dalquest and his students. We also have a tissue collection currently with over 515 samples preserved in 100% ethanol frozen in liquid nitrogen. Our type collection includes 3 holotypes, 110 paratypes, and 1 allotype. Our holdings were collected between 1927 and present and there was a significant increase in collections during 1950–1980, mainly by Clark Hubbs and his students. In 1993 we acquired the collections of the University of Texas at Austin’s Marine Science Institute, totaling ~ 3,000 lots of ethanol preserved specimens from the Gulf of Mexico. Between 2000 and 2011 we acquired collections of ethanol preserved specimens from Midwestern University, Texas Tech University, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, The University of Texas at Brownsville and Lamar University. We are working on cataloging these specimens, and will make those data available as soon as possible. Our collection is rapidly growing and many of our incoming specimens come from Dean Hendrickson and his students, museum staff, Texas Parks and Wildlife, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and various researchers.
