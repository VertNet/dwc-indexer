The holdings include specimens from 156 countries, including 83,540 specimens from the U.S., 32,304 from Ecuador, 29,965 from Mexico, 24,684 from the Dominican Republic, 18,130 from Costa Rica, 18,000 from Haiti, 16,789 from the Philippines, 12,645 from Peru, and 12,570 from Panama.<br><br>  The KU Herpetology collections are strongest in the Neotropical realm (208,009, or ±65% of the collection) but the Nearctic (83,906, ±26%), and Asian (21,032, ±6.5%) holdings are also substantial. At 23,923 specimens (±7.5%) the collection from Kansas is the largest and most important systematic collection of the state’s herpetofauna in existence.<br><br>  The collections at KU include 5412 amphibian and reptile species, with 2865 Amphibians (2547 species of Anura, 272 species of Caudata, and 46 species of Gymnophiona) and 2865 Reptiles (27 species of Amphisbaenia, 12 Crocodilia, 1 Rhynchocephalia, 1526 Sauria, 1159 Serpentes, and 140 Testudinea).<br><br>  Mostly resulting from the research program of Curator Linda Trueb, KU has an outstanding collection of 5580 cleared-and-stained osteological preparations and 4798 dry skeletons. Likewise, the collection of amphibian larvae consists of 6243 lots.<br><br>  The KU Herpetological Digital Archive includes 12,156 digitized images and 1,657 acoustic recordings.
