The major strengths of the collection, amphibians from the southeastern United States and both reptiles and amphibians from the Northeast, reflects the intensive collection by the Wrights. Much of the material collected by the Wrights in New York and Georgia is not duplicated elsewhere. At present, the cataloged collection contains 44,300 alcoholic specimens, 238 dry skeletons, and 486 cleared and stained specimens. In all appoximately 300 species of amphibians and 500 species of reptiles are represented. The last 15 years have been seen important acquisitions for the collection. To complement our traditional strength in North American taxa, we have made a concerted effort to obtain foreign material, especially synoptic series representing geographic areas. This material includes research specimens collected by Dr. F. Harvey Pough in Western and South Australia. The donation of his personal collection by Dr. Kraig Adler (Neurobiology and Behavior) has added more than 100 new species to the collection. Through collecting, exchanges and acquisition of other various collections we now have good representation of Costa Rican viperids, lizards from Western and South Australia, amphibians and reptiles from Puerto Rico, snakes and lizards from Mexico, and a more representative collection of African and European species.
