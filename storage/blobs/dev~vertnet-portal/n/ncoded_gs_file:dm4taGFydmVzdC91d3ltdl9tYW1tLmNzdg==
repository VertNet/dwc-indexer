It is a part of the Department of Zoology and Physiology. The UWYMV Mammal Collection is focused regionally on Wyoming and taxonomically on muskrats, deer mice, and bobcats. There are small series of a variety of mammals from throughout the Rocky Mountain region. The majority of specimens were collected from the 1940s through the 1970s, but the collection is currently undergoing rapid expansion.
