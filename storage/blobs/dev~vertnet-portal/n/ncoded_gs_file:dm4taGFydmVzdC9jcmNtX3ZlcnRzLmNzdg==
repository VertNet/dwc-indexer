Conner Museum (CRCM) houses a vertebrate research collection. The collection includes specimens from around the world, but the geographic emphasis is on the Inland Northwest of the US.  The vast majority of the specimens are from Washington, Idaho, and adjacent states.  As of 2012, most of the (non-pickled) bird and mammal records had been entered into the computer database and are available online. Records for the pickled specimens (fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds) will probably not be available online until 2014.	Kelly Cassidy	Charles R.
