A large proportion of the collection is composed of amphibians and reptiles from the United States (46 states are represented), and many of these species are from the Southern Plains and Oklahoma. Approximately 60% (~31,000 specimens) of the collection is made up of Oklahoma specimens, making it the largest repository of Oklahoma reptiles and amphibians. The collection also contains specimens from a total of 50 countries, with relatively large numbers from Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador, and Egypt. An early collection of specimens is from the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.

A large proportion of the collection is composed of amphibians and reptiles from the United States (46 states are represented), and many of these species are from the Southern Plains and Oklahoma. Approximately 60% (~31,000 specimens) of the collection is made up of Oklahoma specimens, making it the largest repository of Oklahoma reptiles and amphibians. The collection also contains specimens from a total of 50 countries, with relatively large numbers from Brazil, Mexico, Ecuador, and Egypt. An early collection of specimens is from the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
